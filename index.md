## The title of this project is: Investigating the Molecular Mechanisms of Sex Change in Teleosts Through the Study of the Cyp19a1 Genes

## Authors: Emily Earls and Madison Gordon

**Abstract:**  üê†üê†üê†
Hermaphroditic sex expression is evidenced in many different families of coral reef fishes and has aided the ability of these fishes to successfully evolve. Fishes expressing simultaneous hermaphroditism possess female and male gonads, while fishes expressing sequential hermaphroditism undergo sex change. Protandrous fishes possess female gonads that change to male gonads, and protandrous fishes possess male gonads that change to female gonads. Clownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites and undergo sex change upon the removal of the dominant female. The sex change influences the external appearance of the fish, alters internal gonads, and induces the production of female gametes. Cyp19a1 is suspected to play a major role in sex change. The gene encodes aromatase, which synthesizes estrogen by aromatizing androgens. Cyp19a1 has been attributed to gonadal differentiation and development. In fish species, aromatase is encoded by Cyp19a1a and Cyp19a1b, two genes that are differentially expressed. Cyp19a1a is mostly expressed throughout the gonads, while Cyp19a1b is predominantly expressed in the brain and pituitary gland. In this study, we will analyze the evolution of these genes in teleosts to better understand its role in sex determination.

**Introduction:** üê†üê†üê†
For a single clade, fish exhibit some of the most diverse mating behaviors. Although they have evolved recently, teleosts exhibit almost every mating strategy possible. Perhaps, their evolutionary success is due to the extent of phenotypic plasticity in reproductive strategies. Clownfish, or Amphiprion ocellaris, employ a unique reproductive strategy known as sequential hermaphroditism. Clownfish live in harems with one dominant female, one larger male, and many smaller males. Upon the removal or death of the dominant female, the larger male will undergo a sex change, altering its internal gonads and gamete production. Sequential hermaphroditism is a beneficial mating strategy in ecosystems where space is a limiting resource.
Previous studies have identified Cyp19a1 as a crucial gene in the sex change in clownfish. Cyp19a1 encodes the aromatase enzyme, which is responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Aromatase is crucial in gonadal development and differentiation. In fish species, the enzyme is encoded by two gene variants: cyp19a1a which is expressed in the gonads and cyp19a1b which is expressed in the brain and pituitary gland. Previous studies have demonstrated an overexpression of cyp19a1b in clownfish undergoing sex change. 
This study will investigate the evolutionary history of the gene using phylogenetic analysis and analyze its relationship with mating patterns in teleosts. 

**Methods:** üê†üê†üê†
Analysis of cyp19a1a
‚Ä¢	In GenBank, the cyp19a1a gene for clownfish was identified. The ortholog for this gene was identified in other teleosts. All of the sequences were downloaded in fasta format. The following fish species will be examined: clownfish, Japanese medaka, Indian medaka, ballan wrasse, zig zag eel, yellow perch, Nile tilapia, flier cichlid, guppy, mummichog, Atlantic cod, Coho salmon, zebrafish, yellowhead catfish, and Mexican tetra 
‚Ä¢	These sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL in Mega with a gap penalty of 10.00 and an extension penalty of 5.00. 
‚Ä¢	Using Mega, the model of best fit was identified as Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano with gamma distribution
‚Ä¢	A tree of maximum likelihood was created with these parameters
Analysis of cyp19a1b
‚Ä¢	In GenBank, the cyp19a1b gene for clownfish was identified. The ortholog for this gene was identified in other teleosts. All of the sequences were downloaded in fasta format. The following fish species will be examined: clownfish, Japanese medaka, Indian medaka, ballan wrasse, zig zag eel, yellow perch, Nile tilapia, flier cichlid, guppy, mummichog, Atlantic cod, Coho salmon, zebrafish, yellowhead catfish, and Mexican tetra 
‚Ä¢	These sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL in Mega with a gap penalty of 10.00 and an extension penalty of 5.00. 
‚Ä¢	Using Mega, the model of best fit was identified as Tamuro and Nei 1993 model with gamma distribution
